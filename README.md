### This is implementation of the idb-keyval using CoffeeScript.
### Original code is located here: https://www.npmjs.com/package/idb-keyval

### I like idea of idb-keyval, really super-simple-small keyval store build on top of IndexedDB
### I just cannot stop myself from making it even smaller, so I made a port of the idb-keyval to CoffeeScript :)
